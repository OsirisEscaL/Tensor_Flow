This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

iii. Category table = 10000
iv. Checkin table = 10000
v. elite_years table = 10000
vi. friend table = 10000
vii. hours table = 10000
viii. photo table = 10000
ix. review table = 10000
x. tip table = 10000
xi. user table = 10000

SQL code used to arrive at answer:

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM attribute

SELECT COUNT(*)

+------------------------+--------+--------------+

8. Does posing more reviews correlate with more fans?

	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results: 

As the excerpt from the table of review counts and number of fans below demonstrates, there is no correlation between many reviews and the number of followers. It depends more on the caliber of the user's judgment, the duration of the user's assistance, and the resource's utility for the community.

SQL code used to arrive at answer:

SELECT name
,review_count
,fans
FROM user LEFT JOIN review
ON user.id=review.user_id
ORDER BY review_count DESC
LIMIT 5

+---------+--------------+------+
| name    | review_count | fans |
+---------+--------------+------+
| Gerald  |         2000 |  253 |
| Sara    |         1629 |   50 |

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?

For the food category, only one business qualified for the 2-3 group, i.e., Loblaws, and two for the 4-5 group, i.e., Cabin Fever and Halo Brewery. In comparison, Loblaws is open daily from 8:00 to 22:00. In contrast, Cabin Fever is available from 16:00 to 2:00. Halo Brewery is open from 15:00 to 21:00, and the weekends are open from 11:00 to 21:00. So, there is a stark difference in the distribution of hours.

ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?

Loblaws has ten reviews, while the 4-5-star establishments have amassed 15 and 26 reviews, respectively. With 26 reviews and a 4-5-star rating, the Cabin Fever is quite well-liked by the locals.
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.

The location and neighborhood don’t provide sufficient details to reach any significant conclusion. All the different businesses have different postal codes and areas. So, due to insufficient data, I can not get a  concrete decision on the correlation between star rating and location detail.

SQL code used for analysis:

SELECT
CASE
WHEN stars>=4 THEN '4-5 Stars'
WHEN (stars>=2 AND stars<=3) THEN '2-3 Stars'
END as rating
,postal_code
,review_count
,hours.hours
,name
,neighborhood
FROM business INNER JOIN category
ON business.id=category.business_id
INNER JOIN hours
ON business.id=hours.business_id
WHERE city='Toronto'
AND category = 'Food'
AND (stars>=4 OR (stars <3 and stars>2))
ORDER BY stars DESC, hours DESC

+-----------+-------------+--------------+-----------------------+--------------+-----------------+

+-----------+-------------+--------------+-----------------------+--------------+-----------------+

2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1:

On average, operational businesses accumulate a more significant number of evaluations compared to their closed counterparts.
Open: AVG(review_count) = 31.76
Closed: AVG(review_count) = 23.2
         
ii. Difference 2:
      
Operational businesses receive a higher mean star rating in comparison to those that are closed.   
Open: AVG(stars) = 3.68
Closed: AVG(stars) = 3.52
                  
SQL code used for analysis:

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(id)) AS Number_of_business
,ROUND(AVG(review_count),2) AS avg_review
,SUM(review_count) AS total_review
,ROUND(AVG(stars),2) AS avg_rating
,is_open
FROM business
GROUP BY is_open
	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:

Predicting how many stars a business will have with only the attributes and categories.
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:

To better help businesses understand the importance of different factors, which will help their business have better qualifications. I used categories and attributes to better distinguish between different types of companies.
                                             
iii. Output of your finished dataset:
